Title,Provides Foreach Looping Construct
Description,"Support for the foreach looping construct.  Foreach is an
idiom that allows for iterating over elements in a collection,
without the use of an explicit loop counter.  This package in
particular is intended to be used for its return value, rather
than for its side effects.  In that sense, it is similar to the
standard lapply function, but doesn't require the evaluation
of a function.  Using foreach without side effects also
facilitates executing the loop in parallel."
