Metric,Measure,Reason for Inclusion
Has vignette?,Yes/no,It is good practice to provide additional help documentation for a package in the form of one or more vignettes.
Has website?,Yes/no,"It is good practice to maintain a website with further information about the package, contact details, and other supporting information."
Source code maintained publicly?,Yes/no,"The use of source control is good practice that facilitates development.  In general, it will not be possible to determine whether the maintainer is using a source code repository unless this is in the public domain."
Formal bug tracking?,Yes/no,"Bugs can be logged by emails, but the better practice is to provide a formal mechanism for bug tracking."
Has news feed?,Yes/no,"A news feed is good practice as it makes users aware of updates to the package, thereby highlighting the areas of greatest risk."
Release rate (18 months),Count,"A stable but continuing release pattern is a sign of active maintenance.  Active maintenance reduces the risk of bugs/errors and so a higher frequency indicates a reduced risk.  However, it should be noted that as a package stabilises over time, the release rate may slow.  When interpreting this metric it is therefore also important to consider the package maturity."
Size of codebase (lines of code),Number of lines of code,"The larger the code base, the greater the risk of error"
License,Eg GPL-2,Certain licenses can be prohibitive and restrict the commercial use of a package.  The license should be noted and compared with an acceptable set of licenses as identified by an organisations legal team.
Author exposure,Number of downloads of other packages by the same author,"If an author has created multiple packages, this can be a sign that they are an experienced developer.  A simple count of the number of times their other packages have been downloaded is a measure of their relative 'success' as an author."
